##HYPERPARAMETER
The process of optimizing the performance of ml model by selecting the best combination of hyperparameters.
Common Hyperparameters in ML alg:
L1 AND L2 regularization
max_depth,criterion
n_estimators
max_features
learning_rate
subsample
kernel, gamma
n_neighbors,metric
batch_size, dropout rate

Hyperpara Tuning Techniques:
1.Grid Search: For small and well defined hyperpara spaces
2. Random Search:Faster for large spaces
3.Bayesian Optimization:Best for complex models and large datasets
4. Automated ML: Automates the tuning process for quick results

Evaluation Metrics for Tuning:
Classification:accuracy,f1 score, precision,recall,roc auc curve
Regression:mse,rmse,r2 score


##CROSS VALIDATION
Technique to evaluate the performance of ml models amd ensure they generalize well to unseen data.

Types:
K-fold CV:
CV Score=1/K E ScorEi
If K=5, the model is trained 5 times,each time using 4/5 of the data for training and 1/5 for testing.

Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation:

Leave One Out CV(LOOCV):
loo=LeaveOneOut()

Time Series CV
