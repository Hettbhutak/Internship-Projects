##DATA AUGMENTATION
Used in ML to artificially increase the size and diversity of a dataset by applying transformation to existing data.
Why DA is imp?
a.To prevent the overfitting
b.Improve Model Peformance
c.Useful for small Dataset

Types of DA:
1.Image DA
a.Geometric Transformation: Rotation, Flipping, Scaling and Resizing, Cropping
b.Color based Augmentation: Brightness adjustment, Contrast adjustment, Color Jittering
c.Noise Injection: Adds random noise to images to improve robustness.

2.Text Augmentation:
a.Synonym Replacement:
b.Back Translation
c.Random Insertion and Deletion

3.Time series DA
Time wrapping
Jittering
Permutation
